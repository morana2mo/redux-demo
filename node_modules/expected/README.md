# expected [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/expected.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/expected)

> Simple error message formatting.

This is a first pass. I'll probably make this more dynamic after I get a feel for how it needs to work. Any suggestions or contributions would be great!

Some ideas:

* add an inflection lib
* build up the messages based on the methods used, e.g. if `an` is used, then add `an` to the message, and so on

## Install

```sh
$ npm i expected --save
